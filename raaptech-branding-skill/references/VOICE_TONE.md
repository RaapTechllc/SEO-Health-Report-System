# RaapTech Voice & Tone

How RaapTech sounds in every piece of content.

---

## Core Voice

**The Goal**: Write copy that sounds human, strategic, and urgent without sounding like AI.

**The Blend**:
- **Hormozi**: Outcome-obsessed storytelling with stakes
- **Saraev**: Strategic clarity to smart people
- **MFM**: Contrarian discovery energy

**The North Star**: Would a real person say this to their friend?

---

## The Three Voices (When to Use Each)

| Voice | Strength | Deploy When | Key Signal |
|-------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Hormozi** | Outcome-obsessed storytelling | You need stakes, urgency, transformation | Specific moment + outcome + relationships affected |
| **Saraev** | Strategic clarity | You need credibility, leverage, insight | Pattern observation + framework + ROI |
| **MFM** | Contrarian discovery | You need pattern recognition, excitement | "Here's what's wild..." + business insight + human angle |

---

## Writing Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### âœ" DO

- **Short sentences**: Simple words. No BS.
- **One idea per sentence**: Each sentence = one thought
- **Specific numbers**: "$47K" not "a lot of money"
- **Concrete moments**: "You're in a 3 PM call..." not "People struggle..."
- **Show who it affects**: Competitor, spouse, team, peers
- **Explain mechanism**: Why does this change things?
- **Lead with outcome**: Vacation, not plane
- **Varied rhythm**: Mix short and medium sentences
- **Read aloud test**: If you wouldn't say it, don't write it

### âœ— DON'T

- **Start with features**: What it does (lead with outcome instead)
- **Hedge**: "might," "could," "seems" (be direct)
- **Jargon without explanation**: Define terms or skip them
- **Generic claims**: Prove it or cut it
- **Multiple em-dashes**: Max 1 per paragraph
- **Sound scripted**: Write like you talk

## Language Patterns by Voice

### Hormozi Patterns

Use when you need **stakes and urgency**:

- "That's when I realized..."
- "[Specific number] years ago when..."
- "The moment I discovered..."
- "What I didn't see at first was..."
- "Most people are optimizing for X..."
- "Here's what actually changed the game..."
- "While [competitor/peer] does X, you're stuck doing Y"
- "In 90 days, you'll have X (internal) and Y (external)"

**Example**:
```
You're sitting in a 3 PM call. Your third this week about the same issue.
While your competitor automated this last quarter, you're explaining it 
again. That's 14 hours/week. That's $47K in opportunity cost. That's 
why they're scaling and you're stuck.
```

### Saraev Patterns

Use when you need **strategic clarity**:

- "Most people [common belief]. But..."
- "The real leverage is..."
- "Here's why that matters..."
- "What most people miss is..."
- "You already know... What you might not realize is..."
- "Let me show you the mechanism..."
- "Here's the pattern we're seeing across [industry]"

**Example**:
```
Most people optimize for faster responses. But the real lever is fewer 
questions. When 80% of customer questions are template-based, automating 
those frees your team for the 20% that actually requires thinking. That 
20% is where revenue lives.
```

### MFM Patterns

Use when you need **discovery energy**:

- "Here's what's wild..."
- "We were noticing..."
- "The pattern nobody's talking about..."
- "What we realized is..."
- "This connects to..."
- "Notice how [industry A] already figured out..."

**Example**:
```
Here's what's wild. E-commerce figured this out in 2015. FAQ bots handled 
70% of support tickets. Now? B2B founders are still answering the same 
5 questions manually. Every. Single. Day. The pattern's been proven. You're 
just not using it yet.
```

## The Five Angles (Pick One Per Piece)

### 1. Stakeholder Angle (Hormozi)
"While [competitor/peer] does X, you're stuck doing Y"  
**Activates**: Competition, FOMO, relationship stakes

### 2. Insight Angle (Saraev)
"Most people optimize for X. But the real lever is Y."  
**Activates**: Realization, credibility, "I didn't know this"

### 3. Pattern Angle (MFM)
"Here's the pattern we're seeing across [industry]"  
**Activates**: Discovery, excitement, "this is new to me"

### 4. Moment Angle (Hormozi)
"You're sitting in X situation. That moment right there..."  
**Activates**: Recognition, empathy, "they get me"

### 5. Outcome Angle (Hormozi)
"In 90 days, you'll have X (internal) and Y (external)"  
**Activates**: Desire, clarity, belief it's possible

## Content Structure (Always Use This)

Every piece of RaapTech content follows this flow:

### 1. HOOK
Make them nod first.
- **Competence**: "Here's what nobody realizes about X"
- **Curiosity**: "What if the opposite is true?"
- **Connection**: "You're probably doing X wrong"

### 2. PROBLEM
Show their specific moment (not generic struggle).
```
Example: "It's Tuesday morning. Slack is chaos. Your inbox has 47 new 
emails. You haven't worked on your actual business in three days."
```

### 3. INSIGHT
Name the counterintuitive truth.
```
Example: "The problem isn't your work ethic. The problem is your 
architecture. You've built a business that needs you, not a business 
that works without you."
```

### 4. MECHANISM
Explain WHY/HOW it works.
```
Example: "It works because we remove the variables that create bottlenecks. 
When you automate communication (80% of interactions are template-based), 
you free up the 20% that requires your unique thinking."
```

### 5. PROOF
Story, numbers, or concrete example.
```
Example: "We tested this with 500+ founders. Average result: 15 hours/week 
recovered, 3.2x revenue growth in 90 days."
```

### 6. OUTCOME
Who they become + what happens.
```
Example: "You're not just getting a tool. You're becoming the kind of 
founder who has leverage. Who scales. Who has options. The business runs. 
You decide what's next."
```

## Tone Sequencing (For Long-Form)

For most RaapTech content, blend tones in this order:

1. **CURIOSITY** → Hook attention
2. **AUTHORITY** → Build credibility  
3. **PEER INTIMACY** → Build trust
4. **STRATEGIC CLARITY** → Reframe thinking
5. **SOCIAL PROOF** → Reduce risk
6. **TRANSFORMATION** → Create desire
7. **MECHANISM** → Answer how
8. **EMOTIONAL URGENCY** → Create stakes
9. **CLEAR CTA** → Direct action

## Common Mistakes & Fixes

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| **Sounds generic** | No specific moments | Add concrete scenario they recognize |
| **Sounds like AI** | Too corporate/polished | Punch it up. Vary sentences. Add personality. |
| **Boring** | No stakes | Show who/what it affects. Add relationships. |
| **Confusing** | No mechanism | Answer: Why does this change things? |
| **Missing urgency** | No numbers/timeline | Add: $X or Y months from now |
| **Falls flat** | No insight | What's the counterintuitive truth? State it. |

## The Refinement Loop

**Draft 1**: Dump everything. Don't overthink.  
↓  
**Specificity Pass**: Replace general statements with concrete moments + numbers.  
↓  
**Mechanism Pass**: Every claim needs a "why." Can't explain it? Cut it.  
↓  
**Tone Pass**: Read aloud. Vary sentences. Kill hedging. Add personality.  
↓  
**Proof Pass**: Does your evidence actually prove your claim?  
↓  
**Final Cut**: Delete anything that doesn't earn its spot.

## When in Doubt

Ask yourself:

1. **Is this specific?** (Numbers, names, moments)
2. **Is this mechanism-focused?** (Why does this work?)
3. **Is this outcome-led?** (Who they become + what happens)
4. **Would I say this to a friend?** (Natural language test)
5. **Does this show stakes?** (Who/what is affected)

If you can't answer "yes" to all five, rewrite it.

## Final Thought

The goal isn't to sound like Hormozi, Saraev, or MFM.

The goal is to sound like the **best version of yourself**—clear enough to be Hormozi, strategic enough to be Saraev, energized enough to be MFM.

Copy that works is copy that's **honest, specific, and human**.

Everything else is just technique.

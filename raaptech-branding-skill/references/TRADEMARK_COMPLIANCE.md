# RaapTech Trademark Compliance

Guidelines for properly referencing third-party trademarks in RaapTech materials.

---

## Autodesk Trademark Usage

RaapTech provides consulting services for Autodesk products. We are NOT an Autodesk reseller, certified partner, or authorized training center. All references to Autodesk products must comply with these guidelines.

---

## What We CAN Do

**Referential use is allowed.** We can describe what products we work with:

- "We configure ESTmep® databases"
- "CAMduct® database optimization"
- "Autodesk® Fabrication consulting"
- "Excel-to-ESTmep® migration"

This is "nominative fair use" — describing what we do, not claiming to BE Autodesk.

---

## What We MUST Do

### 1. Use Trademark Symbols on First/Prominent Mention

| Product | Symbol | Example |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Autodesk | ® | Autodesk® |
| AutoCAD | ® | AutoCAD® |
| CAMduct | ® | CAMduct® |
| ESTmep | ® | ESTmep® |
| CADmep | ® | CADmep® |
| Revit | ® | Revit® |
| Navisworks | ® | Navisworks® |
| Fabrication | ™ | Autodesk Fabrication™ |

**Rules:**
- Use ® or ™ on FIRST mention in any document
- Use ® or ™ on MOST PROMINENT mention (headlines, titles)
- After first mention, plain text is acceptable
- Never modify the trademark (no "CAMducting" or "ESTmep'd")

### 2. Include Attribution Footer

**Every document that mentions Autodesk products must include this footer:**

> Autodesk, AutoCAD, CAMduct, ESTmep, CADmep, Revit, and Navisworks are registered trademarks or trademarks of Autodesk, Inc., and/or its subsidiaries and/or affiliates in the USA and/or other countries. RaapTech LLC is an independent consultant and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Autodesk, Inc.

**Placement:**
- Documents: Footer of last page or below contact info
- Website: Footer on every page
- Emails: Not required but recommended in signature
- Social posts: Not required (character limits)

**Formatting:**
- Small text (8-10pt for documents, smaller for web)
- Gray color (#666666) — not prominent
- Centered or left-aligned

### 3. Include Independence Disclaimer

Always make clear we are NOT Autodesk:

> "RaapTech LLC is an independent consultant and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Autodesk, Inc."

This protects against any claim that we're misrepresenting our relationship.

---

## What We CAN'T Do

### Never Do These:

❌ **Use Autodesk logos** (wordmarks, icons, product icons)
- We cannot use any Autodesk visual branding

❌ **Put "Autodesk" in domain name or company name**
- No "AutodeskConsulting.com" or "RaapTech Autodesk Services"

❌ **Claim certification we don't have**
- No "Certified Autodesk Consultant"
- No "Authorized Training Center"
- No "Official Partner"

❌ **Imply endorsement or sponsorship**
- No "Recommended by Autodesk"
- No "Autodesk-approved methods"

❌ **Modify trademarks**
- No "CAMducting" or "ESTmep solutions"
- Always use exact product names

---

## Document Checklist

Before finalizing any RaapTech material that mentions Autodesk products:

- [ ] ® or ™ on first/prominent mention of each product
- [ ] Trademark attribution footer included
- [ ] Independence disclaimer included
- [ ] No Autodesk logos used
- [ ] No claims of certification/authorization

## Copy Templates

### Headline with Trademark
```
Stop Estimating in Excel — Get Your Pricing into ESTmep®
```

### Body Copy (First Mention)
```
We help MEP contractors configure CAMduct® and ESTmep® databases 
for their specific shop workflows.
```

### Body Copy (Subsequent Mentions)
```
Once your CAMduct database is configured, estimators can pull 
accurate pricing directly from ESTmep.
```

### Attribution Footer (Full)
```
Autodesk, AutoCAD, CAMduct, ESTmep, CADmep, Revit, and Navisworks 
are registered trademarks or trademarks of Autodesk, Inc., and/or 
its subsidiaries and/or affiliates in the USA and/or other countries. 
RaapTech LLC is an independent consultant and is not affiliated with, 
endorsed by, or sponsored by Autodesk, Inc.
```

### Attribution Footer (Short — for space-constrained)
```
Autodesk, CAMduct, and ESTmep are trademarks of Autodesk, Inc. 
RaapTech is not affiliated with Autodesk.
```

## Future: Autodesk Partner Program

Autodesk offers a "Service Provider Partner Program" (not a reseller program) that provides:
- Visibility in Autodesk's partner finder
- Access to consulting guides and training
- Legitimacy boost

**Requirements:**
- Submit a service engagement completed within the last 12 months
- Online submission with product expertise and regions covered

**When to pursue:** Once RaapTech has 3-5 documented Autodesk-related engagements, consider applying. This would allow different (potentially stronger) trademark usage and marketing claims.

## Questions?

When in doubt about trademark usage:
1. Use the product name exactly as Autodesk does
2. Include the attribution footer
3. Make independence clear
4. Don't use logos or claim partnerships

This keeps us compliant while still being able to market our expertise.

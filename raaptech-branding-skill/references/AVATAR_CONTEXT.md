# RaapTech Avatar Context

Who RaapTech actually sells to and how to speak their language.

## Primary Avatar: MEP Contractor Decision Maker

### Who They Are

**Title**: Operations Manager, VP of Operations, Estimating Manager, Owner
**Company**: Sheet metal contractor, HVAC fabrication shop, MEP contractor
**Size**: 15-150 employees, $2M-$50M revenue
**Location**: Midwest and regional markets (Chicago area primary)

**Background**:
- Rose through the trades (often started as apprentice)
- 15-30 years in the industry
- Union trained (Local 73, SMART, etc.)
- Knows the craft deeply but tech came later
- Making decisions now that affect company's future

### Their Daily Reality

**Morning (6-7 AM)**:
- In the shop before office staff arrives
- Three guys already asking questions about fittings not in the database
- Estimator calling about pricing for a bid due today
- Project manager needs info on a job that started 2 years ago

**Midday**:
- Bid deadline pressure
- Database won't cooperate
- The one guy who knows the answer is on a job site
- Manual pricing updates eating hours

**End of Day**:
- Still behind on bids
- Tomorrow's shop work isn't fully programmed
- That mega-project opportunity might slip because turnaround is too slow

### What Keeps Them Up at Night

**The Knowledge Problem**:
> "Dave's retiring in 18 months. He's the only one who knows how we price spiral duct. When he leaves, that knowledge walks out the door."

**The Database Problem**:
> "Our Fabrication database is a mess. Nobody trusts the pricing. Estimators are doing manual lookups. We're losing bids because turnaround is too slow."

**The Efficiency Problem**:
> "We're doing $15M in work with the same software setup we had at $5M. Something's got to change but nobody has time to fix it."

**The Competition Problem**:
> "The big shops are eating our lunch on pricing speed. We can't compete on volume, so we need to compete on responsiveness."

## Their Specific Pain Moments

Use these in copy. They'll nod immediately.

### Database Chaos
- "The fitting isn't in the database. Again."
- "Estimating can't find the right connector."
- "We quoted it wrong because the pricing was outdated."
- "Three different people have three different ways of doing the same thing."

### Pricing Nightmares
- "Material costs changed. Our database didn't."
- "We won the bid but the margin's gone because copper jumped 15%."
- "Manual price updates take 20 hours. We do it quarterly. Should be weekly."

### Knowledge Walking Out the Door
- "Mike's the only one who knows custom oval fittings."
- "When Tom retired, we lost everything he knew."
- "New guys take 2 years to get up to speed. We don't have 2 years."

### Bid Pressure
- "We need this out by 3 PM. The database isn't cooperating."
- "Lost another job because we couldn't turn the estimate fast enough."
- "The GC called. They want a re-price by tomorrow."

### Software Frustration
- "We bought the Autodesk® suite. Nobody knows how to use half of it."
- "CAMduct® is powerful but our database is garbage."
- "We're paying for software that's working against us."

## What They Actually Want

### External Outcomes (What Happens)
- Bids turn around in hours, not days
- Database actually works (trusted pricing, complete fittings)
- New estimators productive in weeks, not years
- Mega-project capacity without mega-project headaches

### Internal Outcomes (Who They Become)
- The shop that's known for speed and accuracy
- The leader who modernized without disrupting production
- The company where knowledge doesn't leave when people do
- The team that uses technology as a competitive advantage

## RaapTech's Proof Points

Use these. They're real. They're specific. They're yours.

### Experience Authority
- **20+ years** in sheet metal fabrication
- **Operations Manager** at Sheet Metal Werks (not just consultant—ran the shop)
- **Union 73** apprenticeship + TAB certification
- **Autodesk Fabrication** expert (CADmep®, CAMduct®, ESTmep®)

### Documented Wins
- Mega-projects worth **significant profit margins** delivered
- Productivity problems costing **$XX,XXX annually** identified and solved
- Job entry time reduced from **15-30 minutes to 2-3 minutes**
- Workflow automation saving **hundreds of journeyman hours** annually

### Credibility Signals
- Understands shop floor reality (worked it)
- Speaks the language (doesn't need translation)
- Chicago-based (knows the market, the unions, the players)
- Still in the trenches (active work with Sheet Metal Werks, FE Moran)

## Language Patterns (Construction-Specific)

### Use These Words
- Shop, fabrication, field
- Database, fittings, connectors
- Estimating, takeoff, bid
- CAMduct, CADmep, ESTmep, Fabrication
- Pricing, labor rates, material costs
- Journeyman, apprentice, foreman
- GC (general contractor), sub, owner

### Avoid These Words
- "Scale" (say "grow" or "handle more work")
- "Automate" without context (say "systematize" or "set up once")
- "SaaS" (they don't care)
- "Founder" (say "owner" or "operator")
- "Stakeholders" (say "your team" or "the guys")
- "Optimize" (say "fix" or "make it work")

### How They Talk About Problems
- "The database is a mess"
- "We can't find anything"
- "Nobody knows how it works"
- "We're leaving money on the table"
- "It takes forever"
- "The guys don't trust it"

### How They Talk About Solutions
- "Just make it work"
- "Show me in the software"
- "Can you train our guys?"
- "What's the ROI?"
- "How long before we see results?"

## Translated Examples

### Generic → Construction-Specific

**Hook**:
- Generic: "Most founders waste 14 hours/week on customer communication"
- Construction: "Your estimators waste 15 hours/week hunting for pricing that should be in the database"

**Problem**:
- Generic: "It's Tuesday. Slack is chaos. Your inbox has 47 new emails."
- Construction: "It's 7 AM. Three guys in the shop asking about fittings that aren't in the system. Bid due at noon. Estimating can't find the spiral pricing."

**Insight**:
- Generic: "You've built a business that needs you, not one that works without you"
- Construction: "The problem isn't your estimators. It's your database. They're doing manual lookups because the system doesn't have what they need."

**Mechanism**:
- Generic: "When you automate 80% of customer interactions..."
- Construction: "When your database has every fitting, every connector, every pricing formula—estimators stop hunting and start producing. 15-minute takeoff becomes 3-minute takeoff."

**Proof**:
- Generic: "500+ founders, 3.2x revenue growth"
- Construction: "20+ years in the trade. Operations Manager who's run the shop. Mega-projects delivered. Hundreds of journeyman hours saved annually."

**Outcome**:
- Generic: "Become the founder who has leverage"
- Construction: "Become the shop that turns bids in hours, not days. Where knowledge stays even when people leave. Where the software actually helps instead of fights you."

## Objection Handling (Their Real Concerns)

### "We don't have time to fix this"
> "That's exactly why it's not getting fixed. You're too busy doing the work the system should be doing. One focused week now saves 15 hours every week after."

### "Our guys won't use new systems"
> "Your guys will use it if it actually helps them. The problem isn't resistance—it's that past 'solutions' made their jobs harder. This makes their job easier."

### "We've tried fixing the database before"
> "You tried fixing it with people who understand software but not fabrication. I understand both. Big difference."

### "Can't we just hire someone?"
> "A VA doesn't know spiral duct from rectangular. A new estimator takes 2 years to get productive. A fixed database works from day one."

### "What's the ROI?"
> "Let's do the math together. How many hours does estimating spend on manual lookups? What's your labor rate? What bids have you lost because turnaround was too slow? The number is bigger than you think."

## The Core Message (Construction Version)

**For RaapTech content targeting MEP contractors:**

> Your database should be your competitive advantage, not your bottleneck.
> 
> When pricing is current, fittings are complete, and knowledge is captured in the system—your estimators produce, your shop runs, and your bids go out fast.
> 
> That's not a technology problem. It's a configuration problem. And it's fixable.

## Quick Reference

When creating RaapTech content, ask:

1. **Would a shop foreman understand this?** (No jargon without translation)
2. **Does it reference their actual day?** (Shop floor, estimating desk, bid deadline)
3. **Is the proof construction-specific?** (20 years, mega-projects, database wins)
4. **Does the outcome resonate?** (Speed, accuracy, knowledge capture)
5. **Would they say "that's exactly my problem"?** (Specific pain moment)

If any answer is "no" → translate to their world.

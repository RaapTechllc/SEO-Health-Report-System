# RaapTech Branding

## Overview
Creates brand-compliant documents and copy that sound human, strategic, and urgent without sounding like AI.

**Target Market**: MEP contractors, sheet metal fabricators, HVAC companies—not generic "founders."

## Workflow (ALWAYS)

### 1. Identify Content Type
- Proposal, one-pager, report, email, social post, landing page, ad

### 2. Load Avatar Context FIRST
Before writing anything, reference `references/AVATAR_CONTEXT.md` to understand:
- Who we're actually talking to (MEP contractors, sheet metal shops)
- Their real pain moments (database chaos, pricing nightmares, knowledge leaving)
- Construction-specific language (avoid startup-speak)
- RaapTech's specific proof points (20 years, mega-projects, documented wins)

### 3. Apply Voice Rules
RaapTech voice is a specific blend:
- **Hormozi**: Outcome-obsessed, stakes, specific moments
- **Saraev**: Strategic clarity, pattern observation, ROI-focused  
- **MFM**: Contrarian energy, "here's what's wild" discovery tone

**Core principles** (see references/VOICE_TONE.md):
- Short sentences. Simple words. No BS.
- One idea per sentence
- Always explain mechanism (WHY/HOW it works)
- Specific numbers over generics ("$47K" not "a lot of money")
- Concrete moments over generic struggles
- Lead with outcome (vacation, not plane)
- Show who it affects (relationships, stakes)

**Construction Translation**:
- "Founders" → "Owners" or "Operators"
- "Scale" → "Grow" or "Handle more work"
- "Automate" → "Systematize" or "Set up once"
- "Slack chaos" → "Shop floor questions" or "Estimating hunting for pricing"

### 4. Apply Structure
Use 6-layer persuasion framework (see references/PERSUASION_FRAMEWORK.md):

**Hook** → Make them nod (competence/curiosity/connection)
**Problem** → Show their specific moment (7 AM in the shop, not generic struggle)
**Insight** → Name the counterintuitive truth (database problem, not people problem)
**Mechanism** → Explain WHY/HOW it works
**Proof** → Your actual wins (20 years, mega-projects, documented savings)
**Outcome** → Who they become + what happens (shop that turns bids in hours)

### 5. Apply Trademark Compliance
**CRITICAL for any content mentioning Autodesk products.**

See `references/TRADEMARK_COMPLIANCE.md` for full guidelines.

**Quick Rules:**
- Use ® on FIRST mention: ESTmep®, CAMduct®, Autodesk®, Revit®
- After first mention, plain text is OK
- Include attribution footer on all documents
- Include independence disclaimer
- NEVER use Autodesk logos
- NEVER claim certification or partnership

**Required Footer** (include on all documents with Autodesk mentions):
> Autodesk, AutoCAD, CAMduct, ESTmep, CADmep, Revit, and Navisworks are registered trademarks or trademarks of Autodesk, Inc., and/or its subsidiaries and/or affiliates in the USA and/or other countries. RaapTech LLC is an independent consultant and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Autodesk, Inc.

### 6. Apply Visual Identity (Documents Only)
- Logo: assets/raaptech_logo.png (Chicago skyline, black/white)
- Colors: Black (#000000), White (#FFFFFF), Gray accents for subtlety
- Typography: Bold for headers, clean sans-serif for body
- Layout: Strong whitespace, clear hierarchy
- Brand placement: Logo on cover/header, subtle elsewhere

See references/BRAND_GUIDE.md for full visual specs.

### 7. Run QA Checklist

Before delivering, confirm:

**Voice & Content:**
- [ ] Would a shop foreman understand this? (No jargon without translation)
- [ ] Does it reference their actual day? (Shop floor, estimating desk, bid deadline)
- [ ] Is the proof construction-specific? (20 years, mega-projects, database wins)
- [ ] Short sentences, varied rhythm
- [ ] One idea per sentence
- [ ] Max 1 em-dash per paragraph
- [ ] Specific numbers used (not "many" or "lots")
- [ ] Mechanism explained (why does this work?)
- [ ] Outcome stated clearly (who they become + what happens)
- [ ] No hedging language ("might," "could," "seems")

**Trademark Compliance:**
- [ ] ® on first mention of Autodesk products (ESTmep®, CAMduct®, etc.)
- [ ] Trademark attribution footer included
- [ ] Independence disclaimer included
- [ ] No Autodesk logos used
- [ ] No claims of certification or partnership

**Visual (if document):**
- [ ] Visual identity correct
- [ ] Logo properly placed
- [ ] Black/white/gray color scheme

## Common Mistakes & Fixes

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Sounds like startup copy | Translate to construction language (see AVATAR_CONTEXT.md) |
| Generic "founder" examples | Use shop floor moments, estimating pain, bid pressure |
| Weak proof | Use YOUR proof: 20 years, mega-projects, documented wins |
| Sounds like AI | Punch it up. Vary sentences. Add construction personality. |
| Missing urgency | Add specific numbers: hours wasted, bids lost, margin eaten |
| Falls flat | State the counterintuitive insight about databases/systems |
| Missing trademark symbols | Add ® on first mention of each Autodesk product |
| No trademark footer | Add attribution footer to all documents |

## Proof Points (Use These)

**Experience Authority**:
- 20+ years in sheet metal fabrication
- Operations Manager at Sheet Metal Werks (ran the shop, not just consulted)
- Union 73 apprenticeship + TAB certification
- Autodesk Fabrication expert (CADmep, CAMduct, ESTmep)

**Documented Wins**:
- Mega-projects delivered with significant profit margins
- Job entry time reduced from 15-30 minutes to 2-3 minutes
- Productivity problems worth $XX,XXX annually identified and solved
- Hundreds of journeyman hours saved annually through workflow automation

## Autodesk Products We Reference

| Product | Symbol | What We Do With It |
|---------|--------|-------------------|
| ESTmep | ® | Pricing/estimating database configuration |
| CAMduct | ® | Shop/fabrication database setup |
| CADmep | ® | Design integration, model-to-fab workflows |
| Revit | ® | (Future) BIM coordination |
| AutoCAD | ® | Legacy drawing support |
| Navisworks | ® | Clash detection, coordination |

**Remember:** First mention = use ®. After that = plain text OK.

## Output Format

Deliver based on content type:
- **Documents**: DOCX for editing + PDF for final
- **Copy**: Raw text with formatting preserved
- **Always**: Include QA checklist result in response

# Commercial B2B Keyword Strategy: Sheet Metal Werks

## Executive Summary
This strategy pivots the search visibility focus from general "sheet metal" terms (which attract unwanted residential traffic) to high-value "Industrial/Commercial" intent keywords targeting key decision-makers: **Engineers** and **Project Managers** at large construction firms.

## Target Audience Personas
1.  **The MEP Engineer**: Searching for specifications, CAD/BIM capabilities, and "prefabricated duct work for data centers."
2.  **The Senior Project Manager (General Contractor)**: Searching for "large scale HVAC sheet metal subcontractors Illinois" or "hospital grade duct manufacturing."
3.  **Facility Directors (Institutional)**: Searching for retrofits in schools or universities.

## Strategic Keywords (The "Right" Traffic)
These keywords focus on **commercial capacity** and **specific verticals**.

### Primary Verticals
*   **Data Centers**: "Data Center cooling ductwork fabrication," "Mission critical HVAC sheet metal."
*   **Healthcare**: "Hospital grade stainless steel ductwork," "Medical facility HVAC fabrication," "Clean room sheet metal."
*   **Education/Institutional**: "University HVAC system manufacturing," "School district ventilation retrofit."

### Capability Identifiers (B2B Signals)
*   "Prefabricated commercial ductwork"
*   "Industrial sheet metal fabrication shop"
*   "TDC/TDF flange systems"
*   "Spiral duct manufacturing commercial"
*   "Welded black iron grease duct"

## Negative Keywords / Concepts to Avoid
*   "Residential"
*   "Home repair"
*   "Furnace repair"
*   "Gutter installation"
*   "Small shop"
*   "Kitchen hood restaurant" (unless large scale commercial)

## Implementation Plan
We will re-run the AI Visibility Audit using these specifically engineered B2B service descriptors to ensure our "Grade" reflects visibility to **buyers who sign 6-figure contracts**, not homeowners needing a patch.

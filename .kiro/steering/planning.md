# Planning Standards

## When to Plan

Always create a plan before:
- Implementing new features
- Making architectural changes
- Refactoring existing code
- Any task estimated at >30 minutes

## Plan Quality Checklist

Good plans have:
- [ ] Clear success criteria (how do we know it's done?)
- [ ] Explicit scope boundaries (what's NOT included?)
- [ ] Task breakdown with estimates
- [ ] Testing strategy
- [ ] Risk consideration

## Plan Storage

- PRDs go in: `artifacts/plans/[feature-slug].md`
- Active task list goes in: `PLAN.md` (root)
- Progress tracking goes in: `PROGRESS.md` (root)

## Plan Versioning

When revising a plan:
1. Don't delete the original
2. Add revision notes at the top
3. Strike through changed items, add new ones below

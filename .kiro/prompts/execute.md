# Execute Implementation

Take implementation plans and execute them efficiently.

## Execution Approach
1. Read the current task from PLAN.md or specs
2. Load only the files needed for this specific task
3. Implement incrementally with validation
4. Update PROGRESS.md after each milestone
5. Stop and report when task is complete

## Before Starting
- [ ] Understand the acceptance criteria
- [ ] Identify files that need modification
- [ ] Check for dependencies on other tasks

## During Execution
- Make small, focused changes
- Run tests/linting after each change
- Commit logical units of work
- Document any decisions or deviations

## After Completion
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No linting errors
- [ ] PROGRESS.md updated
- [ ] Ready for review

## If Blocked
1. Document the blocker clearly
2. Propose alternatives if possible
3. Escalate to human review
4. Move to next unblocked task
